To Do list:

1. Figure out how to insert and read html using javascript again.
2. Test out info.url to get the current url.
	a. does it work?
	b. is it pass by reference or value 
		- ie if I change info.url, will it put something new in the omnibox?
3. How to redirect?
	~ JBAR plugin appears to return something called redirectURL. Investigate.
