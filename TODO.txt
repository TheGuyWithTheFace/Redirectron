To Do list:

-1. Test the darned thing now that it *might* actually do something.

0. ** Figure out how to debug extension. (error messages, console output, etc.) **

1. Figure out how to insert and read html using javascript again.

/*
[DONE]  2. Test out info.url to get the current url.
	a. does it work? *YES (but it doesn't have to be "info", just whatever (??) was
		(c) passed to the function in the first place.
	b. is it pass by reference or value *NO (as far as I can tell)
		- ie if I change info.url, will it put something new in the omnibox?
*/

3. How to redirect?
	~ a JBAR plugin function appears to return something called redirectURL. Investigate.

4. Switch background.js into an event page.

4.5 Find way to prevent button from being clicked multiple times per page. It doesn't
	(c) help anything, and will just slow things down.

5. Clean up code, make sure it matches proper extension conventions and whatnot 
	(c) before uploading to github.
