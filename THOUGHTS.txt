/~General~\

+ Make sure code is well documented and neat before open-sourcing, even if nobody 
	(c) ends up contributing.


/~Implementation~\

~ How it determines if a site is blocked:
	~For now, look through the page once loaded. If title = "blocked request" etc.
	~ (cont.) then it redirects.
	
	+ When icon clicked to manually redirect around, if auto redirection enabled,
		(c) could automatically set that page (title I suppose for now) as the one
		(c) to redirect around if detected. A unobtrusive notification, ie:
		(c) "Setting this page as the default blocker to avoid..." would be nice.

	-Disadvantages:
		- Might be slower since 2 pages will have to load. (blocker, then proxy)

- redirected site should be (or appear to be) the same tab the user was in
	+ avoids confusing user.

+ Ideally, find a chrome API thingy that allows for changing the current tab's url,
	(c) then the app simply reloads the tab with the proxy site prepended.

~ If above API method not availible, could open new tab with modified url, then close
	(c) the previous tab. (figure out how)

~ .appspot websites have limited bandwidth. If used by many people as proxies, it 
	(c) could cause performance issues. What's another good proxy to default to?
	
	+ Perhaps Google Translate?

/~Things to decide about~\

~ Should there be some sort of indicator for when the extension is redirecting?
	+ On one hand, useful for debugging, good to know when extension is in use.
	- On the other hand, screen surfers might be able to see that's it's an extension
		(c) allowing filter bypasses, and disable it.
	~ Maybe have an option to have it on or off?
		+ If so, you could have a way to disable the icon completely!


/~Useful Stuff~\

+ Chrome APIs to possibly use (chrome.tabs. ...):
	+ create
	+ query
!!!	+ update !!! Could this method allow for changing the url property??? [yes]


/~Future Features~\

+ Instead of scanning a loaded html page to see if site was blocked,
	(c) (onResponseStarted or onCompleted),	it could check the HTTP headers before
	(c) the page is rendered. (onHeadersRecieved I suppose?)
		~ Is there an HTTP Error code in the header?
		~ What about using traceroute?

+ After the redirected page has been loaded, return the URL to normal without
	(c) refreshing, to hide evidence of a proxy server.

+ Keyboard shortcut to activate

/~To Do list:~\

0. ** Figure out how to debug extensions. (error messages, console output, etc.) **

1. Figure out how to insert and read html using javascript again.
	+ actually, to get the title just use tab.title.

4.75 incorporate proper icons.

5. Clean up code, make sure it matches proper extension conventions and whatnot 
	(c) before uploading to github.

6. Add an about page?
