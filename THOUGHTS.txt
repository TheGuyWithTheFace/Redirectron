/~General~\

+ Next idea I will have it try to automatically detect if a site has been blocked,
	so it can automatically redirect.


/~Implementation~\

~ How it determines if a site is blocked:
	~For now, look through the page once loaded. If title = "blocked request" etc.
	then it redirects.
	
	+ When icon clicked to manually redirect around, if auto redirection enabled,
		could automatically set that page (title I suppose for now) as the one
		to redirect around if detected. A unobtrusive notification, ie:
		"Setting this page as the default blocker to avoid..." would be nice.

	-Disadvantages:
		- Might be slower since 2 pages will have to load. (blocker, then proxy)
		+ ... but still far more convenient than waiting for user input.

+ In the future, looking at the http headers before the page is completely 
	loaded would be much faster.


/~Things to decide about~\

~ Should there be some sort of indicator for when the extension is redirecting?
	+ On one hand, useful for debugging, good to know when extension is in use.
	- On the other hand, screen surfers might be able to see that's it's an extension
		allowing filter bypasses, and disable it.
	~ Maybe have an option to have it on or off?
		+ If so, you could have a way to disable the icon completely!


/~Useful Stuff~\

chrome API Docs = good!


/~Future Features~\

+ Instead of scanning a loaded html page to see if site was blocked,
	(onResponseStarted or onCompleted),	it could check the HTTP headers before
	the page is rendered. (onHeadersRecieved I suppose?)
		~ Is there an HTTP Error code in the header?
			+ Yes, and a way to retrieve error codes, though I haven't figured
				it out in the docs yet.
		~ What about using traceroute?

+ After the redirected page has been loaded, return the URL to normal without
	refreshing, to hide evidence of a proxy server.

+ Use an https connection to server

/~To Do list:~\

?. Make a better readme

-1. add in workaround for bug in checkIfBlocked

0. Factor out all the chrome.tabs.query statements into a function to just
return the selected tab.

0.5 Figure out once and for all whether to have brackets
	in the same line

1. Make a graphical way for user to set proxy to avoid, other than relying on 
	keyboard shortcuts. (See note above)

1.5 Add in checks to make sure an inputted proxy won't cause an
	error when used.
1.55 Fixed missing https or http, but not a missing .com, .org, .guru, etc.
How might we fix that..?

?6. Add an about page?
