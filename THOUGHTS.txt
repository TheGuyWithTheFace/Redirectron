/~General~\

+ Make sure code is well documented and neat before open-sourcing, even if nobody 
	(c) ends up contributing.


/~Implementation~\

~ How it determines if a site is blocked:
	~For now, look through the page once loaded. If title = "blocked request" etc.
	~ (cont.) then it redirects.

	-Disadvantages:
		- only useful for specific blocker programs, not all.
		- Might be slower since 2 pages will have to load. (blocker, then proxy)
		~ See "future features" for a possible fix.

- redirected site should be (or appear to be) the same tab the user was in
	+ avoids confusing user.

+ Ideally, find a chrome API thingy that allows for changing the current tab's url,
	(c) then the app simply reloads the tab with the proxy site prepended.

~ If above API method not availible, could open new tab with modified url, then close
	(c) the previous tab. (figure out how)

~ .appspot websites have limited bandwidth. If used by many people as proxies, it 
	(c) could cause performance issues. What's another good proxy to default to?
	
	+ Perhaps Google Translate?

/~Things to decide about~\

~ Should there be some sort of indicator for when the extension is redirecting?
	+ On one hand, useful for debugging, good to know when extension is in use.
	- On the other hand, screen surfers might be able to see that's it's an extension
		(c) allowing filter bypasses, and disable it.
	~ Maybe have an option to have it on or off?
		+ If so, you could have a way to disable the icon completely!


/~Useful Stuff~\

+ Chrome APIs to possibly use (chrome.tabs. ...):
	+ create
	+ query
!!!	+ update !!! Could this method allow for changing the url property???


/~Future Features~\

+ Instead of scanning a loaded html page to see if site was blocked,
	(c) (onResponseStarted or onCompleted),	it could check the HTTP headers before
	(c) the page is rendered. (onHeadersRecieved I suppose?)
		~ Is there an HTTP Error code in the header?
		~ What about using traceroute?

+ Make a manual redirect button. (If the blocker isn't detected, user can manually
	(c) click the extension, and it'll redirect for them.)

+ Make a button to recognize a different blocker - when button clicked, saves title
	(c) so extension knows what to redirect around.
