/~General~\

+ Make sure code is well documented and neat before open-sourcing, even if nobody ends up contributing.


/~Implementation~\

- redirected site should be (or appear to be) the same tab the user was in
	+ avoids confusing user.

+ Ideally, find a chrome API thingy that allows for changing the current tab's url, then the app simply reloads the tab with the proxy site prepended.

~ If above API method not availible, could open new tab with modified url, then close the previous tab. (figure out how)


/~Things to decide about~\

~ Should there be some sort of indicator for when the extension is redirecting?
	+ On one hand, useful for debugging, good to know when extension is in use.
	- On the other hand, screen surfers might be able to see that's it's an extensionallowing filter bypasses, and disable it.
	~ Maybe have an option to have it on or off?
		+ If so, you could have a way to disable the icon completely!
